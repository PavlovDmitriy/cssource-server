These are the Architects. Beings of great wisdom and majesty, and the Gods of our world.

This building on their heavenly homeworld, Akkikkosass, may seem ancient- but it is one of their most recent constructions. 

Behind these stone walls lay steel frames that hold an infinitude of wires and conductors, home to the true Architects- not so much 
God as they are sentient electricity, endlessly running through these circuits and contemplating the nature of Reality itself, constructing 
golems to become tangible, and temples to protect the intangible.
